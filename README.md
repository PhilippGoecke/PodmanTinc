## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) installed on your system.
*   `git` for cloning the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/PhilippGoecke/PodmanTinc.git
    cd PodmanTinc
    ```

2.  **Configure your node:**
    - Edit the `Containerfile` to set your node's name and settings.
    - Place the host files for each peer you want to connect with into the `./hosts/` directory.

3.  **Build & Run the container image:**
    A helper script, `podman-run-tinc.bash`, is provided to build the image and run the container with the correct parameters. Review the script and customize it if needed.
        ```bash
        bash podman-run-tinc.bash
        ```
4.  **Share your public key:**
    - After the build, the container will generate and output a public key.
    - Share this public key with the other peers in your network by adding it to their `./hosts/` directories.

## 🚀 Usage

### Start the VPN Node

Run the container in detached mode. Make sure to mount your configuration directory.
